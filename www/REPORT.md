## Development Experience

I have already done quite a few projects with React, so I was already quite familiar with React at the beginning of the project. Initially I was wondering about playing around with the relatively new Remix framework, but I decided to go with the good old `create-react-app` since I did not want to spend too much time familiarizing myself with another new framework on top of `mobx` (so far my projects did not require enough state management to warrant using `redux`/`mobx`), `react-query` and the `WebDSL` side of things.

Overall I have spent around 2 hours getting set up the client side with all the different providers including setting up basic API fetching and state handling.

- state management interesting, react-query for async state (api stuff), mobx for synchronous state (client side selection + preferences)
